# ReactGPT

Welcome to ReactGPT, your new favorite AI assistant. The project was prepared in Figma, and then written in React and Tailwind using the OpenAI API. <br>
You can check the Figma project here: https://shorturl.at/hkCRV <br>
Live version of ReactGPT is available here: https://react-gpt.netlify.app/

On the homepage, we see an input where we can ask a question. On the left side of the menu, we see a button that creates a new chat as well as the history of previous conversations. After clicking on the title of the previous conversation, it will be displayed in the main window.
